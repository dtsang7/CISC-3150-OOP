To figure out why the progam using Thread.sleep() would stop running when you right
clicked and marked texts in the DOS window. I wrote a program to reproduce the same
issue on my macbook but had a different result. While the program on my computer
was running with delay of Thread.sleep(), I right clicked and try to mark texts
in the Terminal, the program was not interrupted. It continues to run regardless of
me doing anything. Therefore I believe that this is a Windows issue.
